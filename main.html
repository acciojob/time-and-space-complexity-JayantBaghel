    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph - Time Complexity -->
    <p>
      Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run
      as a function of the length of the input. When optimizing algorithms, we
      aim for efficient time complexity, ensuring faster execution for larger
      inputs.
    </p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph - Space Complexity -->
    <p>
      Space Complexity is another crucial aspect of algorithm efficiency,
      representing the amount of memory space required by an algorithm. An
      algorithm with <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) means that the memory usage
      grows linearly with the size of the input.
