    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>
      Time complexity measures how efficiently an algorithm's runtime increases
      with input size. It quantifies the number of operations an algorithm
      performs for efficient computation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Space complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm
      requires relative to the input size (n), denoted as O(n). It quantifies
      efficient memory utilization for algorithm execution.
